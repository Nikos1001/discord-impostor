Description: # discord_impostor
        A python package for creating Discord bots that pretend to be real users
        
        ### Installation
        
        To install DiscordImpostor, simply run ```pip install DiscordImpostor```
        
        ### Basic Usage
        
        To login into Discord with DiscordImposter, you need to create and authorize an "Agent".
        
        ```
        
        from DiscordImpostor.Agent import Agent
        
        agent = Agent()
        agent.login('<your-email-here>', '<your-password-here>')
        
        ```
        
        An agent can do many of the actions a normal user can. For example, an agent can read / write messages in a channel
        
        ```
        
        from DiscordImpostor.Channel import Channel
        
        channel = Channel('<channel-id>', agent)
        channel.load()
        
        latest_msg = channel.get_newest_msg()
        print(latest_msg.content)
        
        channel.send_msg('Hello World!')
        
        ```
